The program is called overtones.pde and makes use of the Ess sound library for Processing.

There are 10 sliders on the right controlling the amplitude of 10 sine wave generators representing an overtone series. Holding shift and dragging on a slider changes the offset of the respective wave. A visual representation of the sum wave is displayed.
